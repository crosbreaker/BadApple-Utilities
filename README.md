# BadApple utilities
These are some useful utilities that I have ported to work in the BadApple shell. \
Commands to run them: \

br0ker:  ``curl -LO https://cdn.crosbreaker.dev/daub.sh && sh daub.sh``

Daub: ``curl -LO https://cdn.crosbreaker.dev/daub.sh && sh daub.sh``

Unkeyroll:  ``curl -LO https://cdn.crosbreaker.dev/unkeyroll.sh && sh unkeyroll.sh``
