# BadApple utilities
These are some useful utilities that I have ported to work in the BadApple shell.
Commands to run them:
<br>
Daub: ``curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crosbreaker/BadApple-utilities/main/daub.sh && sh daub.sh``
<br>
Unkeyroll:  ``curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crosbreaker/BadApple-utilities/main/unkeyroll.sh && sh unkeyroll.sh``
